    Are you looking for solutions to exercises and problems in<i> Introduction to Algorithms?</i>
<p>From July 2004 through June 2008, I was the director of the <u>Dartmouth<br> Institute for Writing and Rhetoric.</u>

    I occasionally taught a graduate Computer Science course on how to write papers and how to <br>give talks. I publish
    a <u>list of usage rules</u> that I<br> required my students to observe.

<p> In 2015, PRI's "The World" ran a<u> story on mentoring women in computer<br> science </u>in which a couple of my

    I was interviewed for the<i> Command Line Heroes</i> podcast <u>"Learning the<br> BASICs."</u>
    You can also hear me spout off in<u> "Philosophical Trials #7."<br></u>
    I talked about writing <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> in <u>an episode of "Frank <br>Stajano Explains."</u>

<h2><b><i>Introduction to Algorithms</i></b></h2>
<p>Yes, I am coauthor of Introduction to Algorithms, along with Charles Leiserson, Ron Rivest, and Cliff Stein. For MIT
    Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about the secret to writing a best-selling textbook.</p>
<p> are answers to a few frequently asked questions about Introduction to Algorithms:</p>
<dl>Where can I find a list of errata?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the fourth edition, we maintain an errata page that allows you to
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; list errors by date, by page, or by severity.
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the second and third editions, we maintained an errata page
        that<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allows you to list errors by date, by page, by severity, or by
        discoverer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is even an incremental update feature, allowing you to list
        only<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vthe errors posted siince the last date that you asked about. We
        stopped<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;logging errors for the third edition in January 2019 so that we
        could<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;focus on preparing the fourth edition.
</dl>
<dl><i>How do I report errors?</i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, please visit the errata page to verify that the error has not been
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reported already. Once you have determined that you have found an
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unreported error, send email to clrs-bugs@mit.edu. We will respond as
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quickly as possible, often within a day.</dl>
<dl>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please use the clrs-bugs@mit.edu address only to report errors. If you have
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a suggestion or a question, please contact me directly at <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    thc@cs.dartmouth.edu.</dl>

<dl><i>Do you correct errors? </i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. Each time a new printing is produced, it contains corrections to all errors
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that have been reported by that time. The errata page indicates in which printing <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each error was corrected.</dl>
<dl><i>Can I get solutions to exercise As of the third edition, we are making available solutions for a select set of
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exercises and problems. They are posted at the MIT Press website.</dl>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also produced an Instructor's Manual, which is available only to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instructors who have adopted the book for course use. The manual has lecture
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notes and solutions to additional exercises and problems, but by no means all of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them. (I estimate that writing up solutions to all exercises and problems would
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; takesomewhere between 2000 and 3000 pages.) You'll need to contact the MIT
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press for passwords to access the manual site and the files. (Contact information
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is at the MIT Press website.) You cannot get the passwords from me or from any
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of my coauthors.</dl>
<h3>I will not respond to requests for the manual or for solutions.</h3>
<dl>How can I typeset pseudocode to make it look like the pseudocode in the book?
    <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I created three packages for LaTeX2e. The clrscode package gives you
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pseudocode in the style of the second edition, the clrscode3e package gives
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you pseudocode in the style of the third edition, and the clrscode4e package gives you
    pseudocode in the style of the fourth edition.
